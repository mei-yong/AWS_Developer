SNS - Simple Notification Service

Messaging system
Basically PubSub

[Publisher]-->[Topic]-->[Message Filters]-->[Subscribers]

Note: don't confuse this with SQS (Simple Queue Service). See StackOverflow answer below

You can create filters for your PubSub
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-message-filtering.html
On publisher side, the fields you want to filter on must be set as attributes, NOT as the message body
On subscriber side, you can set up filtering to only receive messages with particular attributes
