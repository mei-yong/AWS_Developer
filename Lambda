Lambda

Serverless functions
Supports Python, Java, node.js, Go, C#, Ruby, Powershell

Triggered by AWS services or API Gateway
Max execution time per request = 900 seconds
Concurrent execution = 1000 parallel executions
No maximum number of functions

When developing in console, give it a test event (must be a JSON) to test execution
Note: if the lambda returns something, that something must be a JSON

You can export the whole lambda as a zip (which would include all the code files and any package dependencies) and upload the zip to some other lambda
If you're going to use particular packages quite often, it's worth making a new layer and having all your lambdas link to and call on the functions/pacakges in that layer
Note: a lambda layer is basically some code that sits somewhere common/shared that many lambdas can access and import from
