Step Functions aka State Machines

Serverless solution that's good for orchestrating lambdas
Note: you can spin up many step function instances in parallel, much like spinning up lambdas

Has different "states" that determine what actions or lambdas are triggered
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-states.html
* Pass - take in data and output data that doesn't require transformations
* Choice - the next step taken depends on the inputs into the state
* Task - invoke a lambda
* Wait - wait x seconds

The code is proprietary AWS and looks like a JSON config
AWS console will automatically make a pretty tree diagram based on your JSON-y code
You can view the tree diagram and see logs as the step function runs. Note: the logs aren't in CloudWatch
