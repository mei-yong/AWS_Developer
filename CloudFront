CloudFront

A CDN - Content Delivery Network
Caching because fetching data from origin (e.g. a S3 bucket in a different region from the end-user or HTTP/HTTPS) for every request is too slow
Enables the origin storage to be kept private
Security based on:
- georestrictions
- signed urls
- signed cookies
- origin access identity (OAI) - integrates with web application firewall (WAF) and AWS Shield (DDoS protection)
