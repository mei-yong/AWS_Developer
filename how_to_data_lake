Optimising for Cost & Performance
Partitioning
Giving attributes to do WHERE clauses on
Compression
Split up splitable formats so that they can be processed in parallel.
Better to have fewer larger files because:
Fewer requests to S3
Faster listing operations – e.g. select count(*)
Less metadata
Faster query


Tech
Glue – data catalog & ETL
S3 – data lake storage
Athena – query with SQL
QuickSight – viz
EMR + Hadoop – analytics (not covered)
SageMaker – ML (not covered)
CloudWatch – all logging is automatically done in CloudWatch
 
Glue
Data Catalog
Hive
Crawls data for discovery – file type, schema, partitions – can be scheduled so you don’t crawl every single time new data comes in
Connected with S3, RDS, Redshift, JDBC, DynamoDB
Versioning
Job Authoring – Spark (python scala)
Auto-generates ETL code that you can then edit
Basic ETL drag and drop that then generates code: Remove, add columns, data type formats
Job Execution
Serverless spins up Spark nodes
Build Workflow by dragging and dropping triggers and jobs/crawlers
Scheduling, event-based/on-demand (lambda trigger), monitoring, alerting
Bookmarks files that were already processed so doesn’t double process if the same file comes in twice
 
Data Lake Formation
A way to automate some of the manual stuff around creating a data lake – e.g. IAM access and basic ingestion
Uses blueprints which covers Glue data catalog – pretty data flow diagram
 
Athena
Serverless
Pay per query
ANSI SQL – uses Presto
$5 per TB scanned from S3
DDL Queries and failed queries free – Hive backend
Federated queries – can query all kinds including relational, non-relational data
Nested schema
SageMaker endpoint support
Memory spill to disk (for really memory intensive queries)
