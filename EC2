EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

Virtual machine instances

1) Pick OS - windows or linux
2) Pick hardware
3) Specify security and access

Host machines have hypervisors that allocate the physical infrastructure to EC2 instances.
Multitenancy: sharing underlying hardware between VMs

Vertical scaling: increase/decrease the size of an instance whenever

CaaS: Compute As A Service


EC2 Types:
* General purpose - balanced compute, memory, networking - web/app servers, code repo, small/medium dbs,
* Compute optimised - gaming servers, high performance computing (HPC), scientific modelling
* Memory optimised - work that requires lots of data to be preloaded from storage to memory
* Accelerated computing - floating point number calculations, graphics processing, data pattern matching, game/app streaming
* Storage optimised - distributed file systems, data warehousing apps, high frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems

Pricing
* On-demand - not recommended for workloads 1+ years
* Savings plans - up to 72% savings - 1 or 3 year term
* Reserved instances - up to 75% discount - 1 or 3 year term - upfront, partial, not upfront
* Spot instances - AWS gives 2 minute warning that they'll take back the instance - up to 90% cost saving
* Dedicated hosts - usually for compliance requirements - most expensive
