Autoscaling

There's a tab for it in the console

Setup so that when there's more traffic, more EC2 instances are spun up and when less traffic, unused EC2 instances are removed
1) Add your EC2 instance to the auto scaling group
2) Set the group size (minimum 2 usually)
3) Specify the VPC + subnets that the EC2 instance requires
4) Enable receiving traffic from load balancer
5) Set scaling + threshold specs

In CloudWatch, enable link with autoscaling group
